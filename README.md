## Brief
in this we use the concept of dividing the image into the grid and then taking multiple boxes of different size on each block of the grid and try to find the object of the corresponding size and hence have a object detection network with real runtime having a operation rate of 60fps. To make the computaion light and precess time low it uses the technique of bottleneck. It helps in reducing the parameters as well as computational cost.
